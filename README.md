# Contact

Hi there! This is an app I created as part of the interview process for a company that will remain unnamed.

## About 

It is a contact list that allows the user to look through their contacts, click on their contacts to see more detail, and toggle whether that contact is part of their favorites.

Also something to note is that I have not had the time to start learning redux. So everything is sent through props :)

## Libraries used

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (for SAPP framework)
* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) (for date formatting)
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) (for AJAX)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) (for CSS framework)
